<h1>Description</h1>
<p>A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape</p>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons warm water</li>
    <li>1 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>⅔ cup warm milk</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>⅔ cup unsalted butter, chilled</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon water</li>

</ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
<li>Combine warm water, yeast, and 1 teaspoon sugar in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Measure flour into a mixing bowl. Combine warm milk, 2 teaspoons sugar, and salt in a separate bowl; blend milk mixture, yeast mixture, and oil into flour. Mix well and knead until smooth. Cover, and let rise until over tripled in volume, about 3 hours.</li>
<li>Deflate gently, and let rise again until doubled, about another 3 hours.</li>
<li>Deflate dough and chill for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Massage butter until pliable, but not soft and oily. Pat dough into a 14x8-inch rectangle</li>
<li>Smear butter over top two-thirds, leaving a 1/4-inch margin all around. Fold unbuttered third over middle third, and buttered top third down over that.</li>
<li>Turn 90 degrees, so that folds are to left and right. Roll out to a 14x6-inch rectangle. Fold in three again. Sprinkle lightly with flour, and put dough in a resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate for 2 hours.</li>
<li>Unwrap, sprinkle with flour, and deflate gently. Roll to a 14x6-inch rectangle, and fold again. Turn 90 degrees, and repeat. Wrap and chill 2 hours.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees</li>
<li>To shape, roll dough out to a 20x5-inch rectangle. Cut in half crosswise, and chill half while shaping the other half. Roll out to a 15x5-inch rectangle. Cut into three 5x5-inch squares. Cut each square in half diagonally.</li>
<li>Roll each triangle lightly to elongate the point, and make it 7 inches long. Grab the other 2 points, and stretch them out slightly as you roll it up.</li>
<li>Place on a baking sheet, curving slightly. Let shaped croissants rise until puffy and light.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, beat together egg and 1 tablespoon water. Glaze croissants with egg wash.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, flaky, and golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
